# Sequential-Chats-and-Customer-Onboarding

This project demonstrates a multi-agent setup designed for customer onboarding using OpenAI's language model. The process involves several specialized agents that sequentially gather customer information, preferences, and engage them with personalized content. The agents interact with a customer proxy agent to simulate user inputs, making the process automated and seamless. This project showcases how conversational agents can collaborate to create a smooth and engaging onboarding experience.
